Git tutoriel : basics commands to get by. (information from the course of Laurent Reveillere)

--------------------------------------------------

git add "filename"
git add . : to add all the files in the folder
git commit -m "message" : To commit changes and then to write a message to describe the commit
git commit -a -m "message" : To commit all the updates without the need to add the files agin

git log : information about commit history

It is not possible to delete a commit. But there are several ways to "undo" one :
git checkout SHAofthecommit : to go to the commit corresponding to the given SHA
git commit --amend -m "message" : change the message of the last commit
git reset --hard : to undo all the changes that have not benn committed yet

------------------------------------------------------

git push origin master
git push : add updates to the global repository
git pull @ : get the last updates from global repository (=from Github)


-----------------------------------------------------
Branchs

git branch : see the state of the current structure, with a "*" in front of the branch you are currently in

git branch new-branch : creates a new branch called "new-branch"

git checkout new_branch : move to the branch called new-branch

--Tip :
git checkout -b new-branch : creates a new branch and moves into it

--------------


To add changes from branch B to the branch A:

git checkout branchA
git merge branchB

This is very useful whenever you want to add your branch updates to the master branch.

-------------

 --To solve a conflict : 
Either git pull -> git commit -> git push
Or edit the local file, then commit again("git commit")

git blame file.ext : Displays the name of the users who have changed the file

git show SHA : displays the changes of the commit corresponding to the given SHA

-------------


If you're working on a branch1, but one of your colleagues calls you for an emergency to work on an other branch2, it is not a good idea to do a commit, as it would burden your history;

Then, how to keep the changes you have made so far before treting the emergency ?
You can use : git stash
Then, go to the emergency branch. Once the problem of branch2 is solved and committed, use : git stash pop to get your updates from branch1 back (Don't forget to commit your changes from branch1 once you have finished !) (pop takes the changes from the stash back)

In order to keep the changes in the stash : git stash apply
